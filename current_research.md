## RETROVIRUS-HOST INTERACTIONS AND INNATE IMMUNITY TO GENE TRANSFER

We are studying the molecular mechanisms of host-vector interplay and innate immunity in the context of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) gene therapy, with particular focus on innate restriction blocks and host responses potentially triggered by the lentiviral vectors (LV) used to convey the therapeutic gene into cells. Clinical application of LV‐based HSPC gene therapy is rapidly becoming a reality. Nevertheless, LV‐mediated signaling and its potential functional consequences on HSPC biology remain poorly understood. The aim is to provide insights into how innate immune signalling may affect human HSC and hematopoietic development in vivo, with potential broad range clinical impact in the field of gene therapy.
