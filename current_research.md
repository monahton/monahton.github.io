## <span style="color:brown"> RETROVIRUS-HOST INTERACTIONS AND INNATE IMMUNITY TO GENE TRANSFER </span>

Our research integrates Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology to investigate the complex interplay between gene editing vectors, host cells, and the immune system, with a focus on advancing gene therapy strategies.  
Leveraging different -omics data such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq), proteomics and metabolomics, we focus on three broad projects: adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-based therapies, inflammatory diseases, and the biology of quiescent human hematopoietic stem cells. We aim to elucidate innate immune sensing mechanisms, particularly the roles of interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (e.g., IFITM3) in antiviral defenses and the regulation of endosomal immune responses. Our recent findings include how interferon-regulated phospholipids influence endosomal immunity and how gene-editing vectors, such as AAV, interact with cellular pathways and immune restrictions.

- In the study of inflammatory diseases like STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) and Aicardi-Gouti√®res syndrome (AGS), we utilized scRNAseq and proteomics analyses to uncover molecular drivers of interferon-driven pathologies. For AGS, which mimics congenital viral infections, our proteomics and transcriptomics analyses highlighted key pathways involved in type I interferon dysregulation and identified potential targets for RNA-based therapies and inhibitors. These integrative approaches provided a comprehensive view of the genetic and proteomic landscape, advancing our understanding of inflammatory pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions.

- Our work on AAV-mediated gene therapy emphasizes the safety and efficacy of these vectors in neurological disorders. Using bulk RNAseq, scRNAseq and single-nucleus RNAseq (snRNAseq), in human and mouse stem cell-derived central nervous system (CNS) models, we demonstrated that AAV vector genomes activate p53-dependent DNA damage responses, leading to STING- and IL-1R-mediated inflammatory pathways. These findings highlight potential neurotoxicity risks and inform strategies to mitigate inflammatory responses, ensuring safer application of AAV therapies for neurological diseases.

- In studying quiescent human hematopoietic stem cells, we employed scRNAseq and bulk RNAseq analyses to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying genomic stability and stress responses. Our analyses revealed critical pathways that maintain stem cell integrity under stress, providing insights into the biology of quiescence and its implications for regenerative medicine.

By combining advanced bioinformatics tools with experimental approaches, our work bridges computational and experimental biology to optimize gene therapy and advance therapeutic solutions for genetic and immune-mediated disorders.

## <span style="color:brown"> HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC DEVELOPMENT AND DISEASE MODELING </span>

Our work centers on modeling human hematopoietic development using pluripotent stem cells to uncover the mechanisms behind blood cells production and hematopoietic stem cells specification. We also explores the genetic causes of hematopoietic disorders such as the Omenn syndrome (OS) using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, aiming to advance regenerative medicine and cell therapy.
