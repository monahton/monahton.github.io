## About Me

I am a computational biologist at the [San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (TIGET)](https://www.hsr.it/en/research/divisions-and-institutes/tiget) in Milan, Italy, where I develop computational solutions that advance gene and cell therapy research. My work sits at the intersection of biology, data science, and medicine—transforming complex multi-omics datasets into actionable insights that drive therapeutic innovation.

With **7+ years of experience** in bioinformatics, I specialize in building reproducible pipelines for genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and single-cell analyses. I am passionate about bridging the gap between raw data and biological discovery, and I thrive in collaborative, multidisciplinary research environments.

Beyond research, I am dedicated to **scientific education**—having delivered **30+ workshops** worldwide through [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and major research institutions including Harvard, the CDC, Genentech, and the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ).
