**Dr. Monah Abou Alezz** is currently a Postdoctoral researcher in the field of gene therapy at the Bioinformatics Core of the **San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (TIGET)** in Milan, Italy. He is part of the following scientific research units:   
- Retrovirus-host interactions and innate immunity to gene transfer group of *Prof. Anna Kajaste-Rudnitski*
- Epigenetic regulation and targeted genome editing group of *Prof. Angelo Lombardo*
- Human hematopoietic development and disease modeling group of *Dr. Andrea Ditadi*   

Dr. Monah obtained his PhD in Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology in 2020 from the University of Pavia, Italy. He carried out his research project in the lab of *Prof. Silvia Bione* in the Computational Biology Unit of the Institue of Molecular Genetics Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza - National Research Council working on the characterization of the genomic and splicing features of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). His early studies were the first to report the accumulation of the GC-AG splice sites in the introns of lncRNAs and their peculiar features that suggest their role in gene expression regulation (Abou Alezz et al., 2020). He worked on the development of new bioinformatics tools and methods for the analysis of gene annotation datasets and RNA-Seq data.

Since 2019, Dr. Monah is a certified instructor in The Carpentries organization teaching coding and data science skills in several workshops across Europe and The United States.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Gene and cell therapy
- Disease modeling
- Long non-coding RNAs
- Data interpretation and statistical analysis
- Development of new bioinformatics tools
- Coding education
