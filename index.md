**Dr. Monah Abou Alezz** is a senior bioinformatician and postdoctoral researcher at the **San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (TIGET)** in Milan, Italy, with a specialized focus in computational biology, gene and cell therapy.  He is a member of TIGET’s Bioinformatics Core and actively contributes to the institute’s high-impact research in two specialized units:  
- Retrovirus-Host Interactions and Innate Immunity in Gene Therapy, under the leadership of Prof. Anna Kajaste-Rudnitski, for investigating host immune responses to viral vectors.
- Human Hematopoietic Development and Disease Modeling, directed by Prof. Andrea Ditadi, where his work is dedicated to advancing computational methods for studying hematopoietic development and genetic disease modeling.

With a Ph.D. in Genetics, Molecular, and Cellular Biology from the University of Pavia, Dr. Abou Alezz has a strong foundation in computational biology and genomics. His doctoral research, conducted at the Computational Biology Unit of the Institute of Molecular Genetics Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza - National Research Council, focused on characterizing the genomic and splicing dynamics of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Under the mentorship of Prof. Silvia Bione, he developed innovative bioinformatics tools for analyzing gene annotation datasets, addressing key challenges in gene function prediction and splicing regulation.

Dr. Monah is a certified instructor and lessons maintainer in The Carpentries organization, teaching coding and data science skills in several workshops across Europe and The United States.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Gene and cell therapy
