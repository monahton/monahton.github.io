**Dr. Monah Abou Alezz** is currently a Postdoctoral researcher in the field of gene therapy at the Bioinformatics Core of the **San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (TIGET)** in Milan, Italy. He is part of the following scientific research units:   
- Retrovirus-host interactions and innate immunity to gene transfer group of *Prof. Anna Kajaste-Rudnitski*
- Human hematopoietic development and disease modeling group of *Prof. Andrea Ditadi*   

Dr. Monah obtained his PhD in Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology in 2020 from the University of Pavia, Italy. He carried out his research project in the lab of *Prof. Silvia Bione* in the Computational Biology Unit of the Institue of Molecular Genetics Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza - National Research Council working on the characterization of the genomic and splicing features of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). He worked on the development of new bioinformatics tools and methods for the analysis of gene annotation datasets.
Currently, his research is focused on (i) studying nucleic acid sensing and innate immunity in gene therapy and disease and (ii) understanding human hematopoietic development.


Dr. Monah is a certified instructor and lessons maintainer in The Carpentries organization, teaching coding and data science skills in several workshops across Europe and The United States.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Gene and cell therapy
- Disease modeling
- Long non-coding RNAs
- Data interpretation and statistical analysis
- Development of new bioinformatics tools
- Coding education
